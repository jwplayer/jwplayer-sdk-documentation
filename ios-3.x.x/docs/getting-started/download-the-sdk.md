### Add SDK to an Xcode project

Now that you have the required items listed in the previous subsection, you can import the JW Player SDK for iOS to your Xcode project.

#### Install CocoaPods and create a Podfile

1. At the Terminal prompt enter `$ gem install cocoapods` to install CocoaPods.
2. Enter `$ cd <path-to-your-project>/<your-project>/` to navigate to your project directory. 
3. Enter `$ pod init` to create a file named **Podfile**. **Podfile** defines the dependencies for your project.


#### Edit the Podfile
1. In a text editor, open **Podfile**.
2. Set the iOS version to `11.0` or greater.
3. If you are using Objective-C, you can comment out `use_frameworks!`. 
4. Add `JWPlayer-SDK` as a dependency. To add a specific version of the SDK, be sure to use the proper <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html" target="_blank">Podfile syntax</a>.
5. Save Podfile and close the text editor. 

```groovy
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
platform :ios, '11.0'

target 'MyAwesomeProject' do
  # Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for MyAwesomeProject
pod 'JWPlayer-SDK', '~> 3.0'
end
```
#### Install the SDK

1. At the terminal prompt of your project directory, enter `$ pod install` to install the JW Player SDK for iOS.
2. Open the **.xcworkspace** file for your project to launch Xcode.
